## How To
The recommended injector for userstyles is [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html).
Install it and then click the install button below to add the theme to the website.

Stylus will open a new tab in your browser that loads the UserCSS userstyle. Make sure to press the `Install style` button, which will be followed by the text “Style Installed” if the installation is successful.

## Notes

This does not theme the payment process as this redirects to the Square Enix site.

If you would like to theme these, add "https://secure.square-enix.com/account/app/svc/top?request=paysyslogin" as an 'Applies to URLs starting with' section. Though, this does not theme the card detail entering page.
